Every semester, we are expected to pick one project idea to work on as a group or individually.

Because of what I was able to learn, I was able to land a summer internship at Ruoff Mortgage as a web developer. As the internship came to a close, I was able to stay on part-time, and eventually full-time, while being a student as well. This change in position has given me an opportunity to work on internal and client facing projects that are important to the company.
